# VisualSketches
Sketches made by me (most of them when I was in highschool) in javascript using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/) or in [Processing](https://processing.org/), which is java-based IDE. 
A part of them are inspired by [Daniel Shiffman's](https://shiffman.net/) youtube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain), and recently, the work of [Casey Reas](https://reas.com/), co-founder of Processing.
Images of the sketches can be found in their corresponding folders.
